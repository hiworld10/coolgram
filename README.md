## Setup

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is needed to install the required framework dependencies. Please consult the documentation in order to know how to use it.

[node.js](https://nodejs.org) is also required. Once installed in your system, compile it in the project by typing in a terminal ```npm install``` followed by ```npm run dev```.

If it is not already present, copy the contents of the *.env.example* file and paste them in a new one named *.env*. Fill it with your own environment values, such as your database credentials, the SMTP server, etc.
